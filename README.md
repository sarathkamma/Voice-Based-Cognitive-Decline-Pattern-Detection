# Voice-Based-Cognitive-Decline-Pattern-Detection

# Cognitive Decline Detection via Voice

This project uses voice-based speech features and unsupervised ML (KMeans) to detect potential signs of cognitive decline.

## Features Extracted
- Duration
- Tempo
- Pitch Variability
- Word Count
- Pauses
- Hesitations
- Speech Rate


- ðŸŸ¢ **Low Risk** â€“ Likely fluent, consistent speech
- ðŸ”´ **High Risk** â€“ Signs of hesitations, pitch variability, slower pace

##  Features Extracted

- **Audio-based**
  - `duration`
  - `tempo`
  - `pitch_variability`
- **Speech pattern**
  - `word_count`
  - `pauses`
  - `hesitations`
  - `speech_rate`

##  Model Details

- **Algorithm**: `KMeans` (unsupervised clustering)
- **Scaling**: Standardized with `StandardScaler`
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: PCA used for visualization only (not in prediction)
- **Clusters**:
  - `Cluster 0`: ðŸŸ¢ Low Risk
  - `Cluster 1`: ðŸ”´ High Risk

## How It Works &Model Details
1. Audio is transcribed and features extracted
2. Features are normalized and clustered using KMeans
3. Based on the cluster, a risk score is assigned (0 = low risk, 1 = high risk)
